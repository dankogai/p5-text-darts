NAME
    Text::Darts - Perl interface to DARTS by Taku Kudoh

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::Darts;
      my @words = qw/ALGOL ANSI ARCO ARPA ARPANET ASCII/;
      my %word   = map { $_ => lc $_ } @words;
      my $td     = Text::Darts->new(@words);
      my $newstr = $td->gsub("ARPANET is a net by ARPA", sub{ "<<$_[0]>>" });
      # $newstr is now "<<ARPANET>> is a net by <<ARPA>>".
      my $lstr   = $td->gsub("ARPANET is a net by ARPA", \%words);
      # $Lstr is now "arpanet is a net by arpa".
      # or
      my $td     = Text::Darts->open("words.darts");
      my $newstr = $td->gsub($str, sub{ 
         qq(<a href="http://dictionary.com/browse/$_[0]">$_[0]</a>)
      }); # link'em all!

DESCRIPTION
    Darts, or Double-ARray Trie System is a C++ Template Library by Taku
    Kudoh. This module makes use of Darts to implement global replace like
    below;

      $str = s{ (foo|bar|baz) }{ "<<$1>>" }msgex;

    The problem with regexp is that it is slow with alterations. Suppose you
    want to anchor all words that appear in /usr/share/dict/words with
    regexp. It would be impractical with regexp but Darts make it practical.

    Since Version 0.05, Text::Darts also accepts a hash reference instead of
    a code reference. In such cases gsub behaves as follows.

      $str = s{ (foo|bar|baz) }{$replacement{$1}}msgx;

    like "s///ge" vs "s///g", this is less flexible but faster.
