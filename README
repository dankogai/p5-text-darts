NAME
    Text::Darts - Perl interface to DARTS by Taku Kudoh

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::Darts; 
      my $td     = Text::Darts->new(qw/ALGOL ANSI ARCO ARPA ARPANET ASCII/);
      my $newstr = $td->gsub("ARPANET is a net by ARPA", sub{ "<<$_[0]>>" });
      $newstr is now "<<ARPANET>> is a net by <<ARPA>>".

DESCRIPTION
    Darts, or Double-ARray Trie System is a C++ Template Library by Taku
    Kudoh. This module makes use of Darts to implement global replace like
    below;

      $str = s{ (foo|bar|baz) }{ "<<$1>>" }msgex;

    The problem with regexp is that it is slow with alterations. Suppose you
    want to anchor all words that appear in /usr/share/dict/words with
    regexp. It would be impractical with regexp but Darts make it practical.
