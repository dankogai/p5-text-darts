NAME
    Text::Darts - Perl interface to DARTS by Taku Kudoh

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::Darts;
      my @words = qw/ALGOL ANSI ARCO ARPA ARPANET ASCII/;
      my %word   = map { $_ => lc $_ } @words;
      my $td     = Text::Darts->new(@words);
      my $newstr = $td->gsub("ARPANET is a net by ARPA", sub{ "<<$_[0]>>" });
      # $newstr is now "<<ARPANET>> is a net by <<ARPA>>".
      my $lstr   = $td->gsub("ARPANET is a net by ARPA", \%words);
      # $Lstr is now "arpanet is a net by arpa".

      # or
      my $td     = Text::Darts->open("words.darts"); # make one with mkdarts
      my $newstr = $td->gsub($str, sub{ 
         qq(<a href="http://dictionary.com/browse/$_[0]">$_[0]</a>)
      }); # link'em all!

DESCRIPTION
    Darts, or Double-ARray Trie System is a C++ Template Library by Taku
    Kudoh. This module makes use of Darts to implement global replace like
    below;

      $str = s{ (foo|bar|baz) }{ "<<$1>>" }msgex;

    The problem with regexp is that it is slow with alterations. Suppose you
    want to anchor all words that appear in /usr/share/dict/words with
    regexp. It would be impractical with regexp. This module makes it
    practical.

    Even if you are using perl 5.10 or better which does TRIE optimization
    internally, you still have to compile the regexp everytime you run the
    script. So it is still more practical to use this module if your match
    is exact -- containing no quantifier.

    Since Version 0.05, Text::Darts also accepts a hash reference instead of
    a code reference. In such cases gsub behaves as follows.

      $str = s{ (foo|bar|baz) }{$replacement{$1}}msgx;

    like "s///ge" vs "s///g", this is less flexible but faster.

REQUIREMENT
    Since Version 0.07, you no longer need to have Darts installed. This
    module now bundles darts.h which is needed to build this module. To get
    the most out of Darts, you still need to install Darts 0.32 or above.
